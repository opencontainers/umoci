**u**moci **m**odifies **O**pen **C**ontainer **i**mages.

umoci (pronounced [/u&#720;mo&#712;&#680;i/][umoci-ipa] or approximately
"oo-mo-tchee") is a reference implementation of the [OCI image
specification][oci-image-spec] and provides users with the ability to create,
manipulate, and otherwise interact with container images. It is designed to be
as small and unopinonated as possible, so as to act as a foundation for larger
systems to be built on top of. The primary method of using umoci is as a
command-line tool:

```ShellSession
  Extract image "leap" from image directory "opensuse" and place it
  inside an OCI runtime-spec bundle at the path "bundle".
% umoci unpack --image opensuse:leap bundle

  Make some changes to the root filesystem ("bundle/rootfs").
% runc run -b bundle ctr
ctr-sh$ zypper install -y foobarbaz
ctr-sh$ exit
% echo foo > bundle/rootfs/README

  Create a new image (called "new-leap") in the image directory "opensuse",
  based on "leap" which contains the changes made to "bundle/rootfs".
% umoci repack --image opensuse:new-leap bundle

  Modify the configuration of the "new-leap" image to specify a new author.
% umoci config --image opensuse:new-leap \
>              --author="Aleksa Sarai <cyphar@cyphar.com>" \
>              --config.workingdir="/var/www"

  Garbage-collect any unreferenced blobs in the image directory "opensuse".
% umoci gc --layout opensuse
```

See [the quick start guide][quickstart] for more accessible documentation about
how to use umoci. Notable users of umoci include:

 * [KIWI][kiwi], which uses umoci to support building both [base and derived
   container images][kiwi-container] which are then converted to Docker images.
 * The [Open Build Service][obs], which uses umoci (through [KIWI][kiwi]) to
   support building and publishing container images from its built-in container
   registry. The openSUSE project has been using this method of building
   container images in production since 2016.
 * [Stacker][stacker], which uses umoci as its core building primitive, and is
   used by Cisco to build container images for some of their appliances since
   2018.
 * [LXC][lxc] provides support for OCI container images through an [OCI
   template][lxc-oci], which is implemented as a shell script that wraps umoci.
   The fact that a container runtime with a vastly different model to OCI
   container runtimes can make use of umoci is further evidence of its
   unopinionated design.
 * [Incus][incus] provides support for OCI container images using umoci as
   well.

### Install ###

Pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [umoci's releases page][releases]. As
umoci's builds are reproducible, a cryptographic checksum file is included in
the release assets. All of the assets are also signed with [one of our release
keys][umoci-keyring], whose fingerprints are:

```text

umoci is also available from several distributions' repositories:

</a>

To build umoci from the [source code][source], a simple `make` should work on
most machines, as should `make install`. If you prefer to use `go install`, you
can use

```
% go install github.com/opencontainers/umoci/cmd/umoci@latest
```

but we recommend using `make` instead.

### Usage ###

umoci has a subcommand-based command-line. For more detailed information, see
the generated man pages (which you can build with `make docs`). You can also
read through our [quick start guide][quickstart].

### Releases and Stability ###

We regularly publish [new releases][releases], with each release being given a
unique identifying version number (as governed by [Semantic Versioning
(SemVer)][semver]). Information about previous releases including the list of
new features, bug fixes and resolved security issues is available in the
[change log][changelog].

Note that while umoci is currently usable as a Go library (and we do have
several users of the Go APIs), the API is explicitly considered **unstable**
until umoci `1.0` is released. However, the umoci CLI API is considered to be
stable despite umoci not being a `1.0` project.

[releases]: https://github.com/opencontainers/umoci/releases
[semver]: http://semver.org/
[changelog]: /CHANGELOG.md

### Governance ###

umoci is an Open Container Initative project, and is thus bound by the [OCI
Code of Conduct][oci-coc] and the [OCI Charter][oci-charter]. In addition, the
umoci project has its own specific [governance rules][governance] which
determine how changes are accepted into the project, how maintainers are added
or removed, how releases are proposed and released, and how the governance
rules are changed. In the case of any conflict which cannot be resolved by this
project's governance rules, the [OCI Technical Oversight Board][oci-tob] may
step in to help resolve the issue.

[oci-coc]: https://github.com/opencontainers/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
[oci-charter]: https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/master/CHARTER.md
<!-- TODO: Add proper governance documents. -->

[oci-tob]: https://opencontainers.org/about/tob/

### History ###

umoci was originally developed in 2016 by Aleksa Sarai as part of the [openSUSE
project][opensuse], and was donated to the Open Container Initiative as a
reference implementation of the [OCI image specification][oci-image-spec] in
mid-2020.
